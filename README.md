# Uconn-HuskyCT-Assignments-script
A TA's help tool to sort assignments on different folders by netID

1. Download assignment files.
To download the assignment files check: http://irc.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/77/2014/03/DownloadAssignments.pdf
2. Unzip the downloaded files in a new folder
3. Change the baseDir variable in the first command of the python script to point to the folder with all the assignments
4. Run the script. It has been tested with Ubuntu linux, but there shouldn't be a problem running it on Windows.
